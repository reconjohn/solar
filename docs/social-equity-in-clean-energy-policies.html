<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Clean energy technologies have been introduced and utilized all over the world for resilient and sustainable energy systems in response to climate change. This rapid transition to the new energy system could lead to undesirable impacts on some communities as shown in the case of telecommunication where the <em>digital divide</em> has excluded vulnerable groups of people from knowledge-based societies and economies (Chen and Wellman 2004). In fact, the European Union (EU) has already experienced that the uneven deployment of energy poverty and socioeconomic characteristics are correlated and the spatial and social distribution of this relationship is highly uneven (Bouzarovski and Tirado Herrero 2017). In this context, it is important to review how residential PV and EV are spatially distributed with a goal of understanding the spatial trends of how clean energy policies and incentives have been implemented. This can help identify issues related to social equity; that is, such uneven distribution may indicate particular communities being left out from the recent development of clean energy technologies, particularly those who are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Literature Review</h2>
<p>The Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA) was signed into law by the Governor of Washington in 2019 to remove greenhouse gas emission from electricity supplies by 2045. It plans to eliminate coal power plants by 2025, at least 80% of electricity should be renewable or non-emitting while up to 20% could be and alternative compliance option, and finally 100% of electricity should be renewable or non-emitting by 2045. Furthermore, RCW 19.405.120 focuses on low-income energy assistance by requiring utilities in Washington to provide energy assistance funding and programs to low-income households from July, 2021. Furthermore, RCW 19.405 aims at equitable distribution of benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“..ensure that all customers are benefiting from the transition to clean energy: Through the equitable distribution of energy and non-energy benefits and reduction of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health and environmental benefits and reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency.” - RCW 19.405.030(8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of energy assistance is to reduce the energy burden of utility customers for weatherization and ownership in distributed energy resources (RCW 19.405.020(15)). In this regard, the Washington State Department of Commerce (DoC) will investigate the demographic characteristics of households and housing characteristics served by energy assistance funding and programs (RCW 19.405.020(3)(a)).</p>
<p>While local governments started to enact policies in consideration of the equitable distribution of energy and its benefits, they are still in the early stage of evaluating clean energy technologies. Therefore, it is imperative to address concerns and issues associated with social equity related to energy access, affordability, security, etc. (i.e., “energy justice”). Energy policies have been dealing with only one portion of the entire energy system while an energy system requires multi- and trans-disciplinary based on practices of integration (Heffron and McCauley 2017). ‘Systems’ thinking was suggested including energy’s externalities for transition to low-carbon sources spanning resource mining, transmission, and waste in social, economic, and environmental impacts (Jenkins et al. 2016).</p>
<p>In this regard, energy justice has been discussed in terms of affordable energy, energy security, fuel poverty, energy vulnerability on distributional unfairness, and politics of energy infrastructure (Fuller and McCauley 2016). Energy justice has been further framed from environmental and climate justice. Energy justice from an inter-disciplinary perspective has recently received significant attention from justice scholars (Jenkins et al. 2016). As a result, energy justice has been conceptualized as one specific academic fields in energy with the concern of equal distribution of costs imposed on communities and benefits from the access of the modern energy in addition to procedures of inclusive decision making (Sovacool et al. 2015). Heffron and McCauley (2017) introduced restorative justice to apply in practice through environmental impact assessments (when a project is designed or built), social-license-to-operate (with local communities over the life-span of the energy infrastructure), and energy financial reserve obligation to ensure the financial capacity to end the energy infrastructure. The authors suggested more just energy trilemma — economics, politics in terms of energy security, and environment for climate change mitigation — targeting on energy law and policy for energy justice. Green investment funds is an example for this energy trilemma (Heffron and McCauley 2017).</p>
<p>Sovacool and Dworkin (2015) discussed eight principles of a decision-making tool: (1) availability for energy security of supply; (2) affordability such as stable prices; (3) due process of stakeholder’s participation in policy making process; (4) good governance with information, accountability, and transparency; (5) sustainability, i.e., meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations; (6) intergenerational equity for present and future generations; (7) intragenerational equity for different communities’ access to energy; (8) and responsibility for the environment, climate change, future generation, and non-human species. Moreover, as a decision-making tool for energy justice, Sovacool et al. (2017) suggested two more principles: resistance, which is standing up to injustice, and intersectionality which is intertwined with socioeconomic, political and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Bouzarovski and Simcock (2017) addressed the lack of geography in consideration of the injustice of energy poverty in terms of spatial justice, the geographical dimensions of inequality and inequity. Spatial justice was discussed in regard to landscapes of material deprivation for infrastructure and the built environment; geographic underpinnings of energy affordability (i.e., energy prices and household incomes); vicious cycles of vulnerability as poor health occurs due to material and socioeconomic spatial inequalities; and spaces of misrecognition, which is defined by recognition injustice through ignoring certain groups, affecting household practices. They claim energy transitions are generators of geographically uneven social, political and environmental displacements leading to vulnerability of particular groups (Bouzarovski and Simcock 2017).</p>
<p>Distributed energy systems have potential to reduce energy poverty (Sovacool et al. 2014) that can help promote social equity. In regard to distribution of energy production, the uneven distribution of production facilities has mainly been framed in environmental justice while an affordable energy access has been framed in terms of income equality and low carbon transitions for energy consumption (Fuller and McCauley 2016). Moreover, proper distribution (distributive justice or redistribution) and impartiality in decision-making (procedural justice and empowerment) are interconnected in that energy justice should be first considered for those that the policies are intended to benefit (Sovacool and Dworkin 2015).</p>
<p>Previous studies have found factors or drivers to the diffusion of clean energy technologies such as socioeconomic characteristics, built environment, peer effects, climate, local regulations and policy variables - spatial neighboring effects, built environment, and policy variables (Graziano and Gillingham 2015); higher income, home owners (Keirstead 2007); home ownership and neighborhood effects (Hofierka et al. 2014); owner occupation, single family versus multifamily development, suburban and rural location, preexisting PV installations (Graziano and Gillingham 2015); population density, single family home (Muller and Rode 2013); additional installation in neighborhood, stronger peer effect (Bollinger et al. 2012); Peer effects such as imitation, herd behavior, and social interaction (Scott et al. 2011); transaction cost such as time spent on negotiating (Seel et al. 2014); and solar irradiation (Schaffer and Brun 2015).</p>
<p>The previous empirical analyses confirm that currently, there are communities not receiving the benefits of clean energy technologies while having cost burden to adopt these technologies. This raises an issue of social justice on the current distribution of clean energy technologies in present clean energy policies. For example, rebates, tax credits, production performance credits, property tax exemptions, and sales tax exemptions are forms of regressive taxation benefiting wealthier households by taxation on populations including low-income households which led to energy inequalities (Poruschi et al. 2019). Opportunities to take part in incentives are hard for those who cannot afford to invest in clean energy technologies. In this regard, a comprehensive, multi-scalar strategic approach spanning the whole energy system in regard to the life cycle is suggested as a less regressive means than carbon taxes or flat levies on energy bills for equity (Bouzarovski and Simcock 2017).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>While a number of studies have investigated various aspects of the policies designed to support residential rooftop PV system (hereafter PV) and residential EV (hereafter EV) charger installations, there is still a dearth of studies aimed at investigating the impact of such policies on social equity. Two unanswered questions have emerged:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are there certain communities inadvertently left out from incentive opportunities?</li>
<li>What is the impacts of current policies on social equity in clean energy technologies?</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer these questions, this study aims to perform a spatial analysis of the distribution of PV and EV charger installed buildings in terms of built environment and socioeconomic characteristics based on census tracts in Seattle, WA. In particular, this study aims to explore patterns of residential structures (single-family and multi-family housing) regarding PV and EV chargers by examining spatial clustering and relationships among variables. The examined data entails socioeconomic and built environment characteristics based on the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS).</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Map clean energy technologies (PV and EV) to verify distribution patterns</li>
<li>Task 2: Find the latent variables of built environment and socioeconomic characteristics using Factor Analysis</li>
<li>Task 3: Verify the suitability of the latent variables to the distribution of PV and EV using clustering analysis</li>
<li>Task 4: Find the significant factors of the distribution patterns using a spatial regression model</li>
<li>Task 5: Find the vulnerable communities to each latent variable using geographically weighted regression (GWR)</li>
<li>Task 6: Assess the social equity in the distribution of clean energy technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This study focuses on the City of Seattle open data portal which keeps the records of electrical permits issued between 2003 and 2019 in the city. Electrical permits are required when home owners install PV and EV chargers on their properties. The present study employed advanced data mining techniques to identify the installations of PV and EV chargers among the data sets. The data includes geographical coordinates (latitudes and longitudes), dates of the PV and EV charger installations, and PV and EV charger contractors who installed the systems. Mapping the points of PV and EV chargers allows the identification of their spatial patterns.</p>
<p>The expected rates of PV and EV chargers per each census tract are estimated based on the total number of housing units and their respective residential PV and EV charger numbers. Standardized Installation Ratio (SIR) is defined by <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, the number of PV and EV chargers over <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>, the expected number of residential PV and EV chargers given the estimated proportion. In this context, SIR refers to the total number of PV and EV chargers over the total number of housing units.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SIR_i = \frac{Y_i}{E_i} \]</span></p>
<p>A Moran’s I test identifies the global clustering in the distribution of the rates of residential PV and EV chargers. A very small p-value confirms that the PV and EV charger rates across census tracts are clustered. This clustering trend can be alleviated by fitting a model with appropriate covariates having similar spatially distributional characteristics. In this context, socioeconomic and built environment characteristics are examined to identify the most proper covariates. Having verified that there is a spatial pattern in the PV and EV charger installation rates, there might be related or shared latent variables in the socioeconomic and built environments in the region.</p>
<p>K-means clustering analysis are performed to identify communities similar in terms of socioeconomic and housing patterns in the region. It should be noted that K-means clustering does not take into account the PV and EV charger installation rates to define the Euclidean distance among data points, clustering of groups is determined only by the latent variables. This will help to characterize the difference among the clustered groups for PV and EV charger distributions.</p>
<p>A Poisson log-normal spatial model is run to address any residual clustering issues using a Bayesian method, Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), which combines Laplace approximations and numerical integration in a very efficient manner. INLA enables Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to address temporal and spatial error terms. Furthermore, an Intrinsic Conditional Auto-Regressive (ICAR) model addresses spatial autocorrelation.</p>

<p>Empirical analyses of PV and EV chargers in Seattle, WA, revealed that (1) there is a clustered pattern in the distribution of clean energy technologies, (2) housing stability and economic status explain the uneven distribution, and (3) some neighbors are more sensitive to the economic status and housing stability with respect to the installations. The current study results revealed social equity issues based on the uneven distribution, i.e., certain communities are underserved.</p>
<p>Current uneven distribution of clean energy technologies are presenting social equity issue. The most significant factors to the uneven distribution were identified: economic status and housing stability. Spatial autocorrelation and clustering issue were addressed by the ICAR model. Furthermore, this study found that socio-economic data from ACS could be used as predictors to estimate the distribution of clean energy technologies for other regions. Finally, sensitive communities to the identified factors were identified for policy makers to address social equity in order for effective and even distribution of clean energy technologies.</p>
