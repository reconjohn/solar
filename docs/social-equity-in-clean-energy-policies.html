<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Energy divide</h3>
<p>Clean energy technologies have been introduced and utilized all over the world seeking more reliable and sustainable energy systems in response to climate change. This rapid transition to the new energy system could lead to undesirable impacts on some communities as shown in the case of telecommunication where the digital divide has excluded vulnerable groups of people from knowledge-based societies and economies (Chen and Wellman 2004). In fact, European Union (EU) has already experienced that the uneven deployment of energy poverty and social distribution are correlated where spatial and social distribution is highly uneven (Bouzarovski and Tirado Herrero 2017). In this context, it is necessary to review how residential PV and EV are spatially distributed with a goal to understand the spatial trends of how clean energy policies and incentives have been implemented. This may help identify issues related to social equity; uneven distribution may indicate particular communities being left out from the recent distribution of clean energy technologies, particularly those who are more vulnerable to the climate change.</p>
</div>
<div id="ev-charging-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> EV charging distribution</h3>
<p>Most charging occurs at home and 50% of EV users charge exclusively at home (Smart 2015). Accommodating home charging opportunities would contribute to EV adoption similar to the case of rooftop solar, where 49% of households are not able to install the solar system due to not owning the building, living in multi-family unit, and lack of roof space (Feldman 2015). In this context, it is necessary to review how residential charging infrastructures are spatially distributed to understand how clean energy policies and incentives have been implemented. This may identify an issue related to social equity; uneven distribution may indicate particular communities being left out of using clean energy technologies, particularly those more vulnerable to the climate change.</p>
</div>
<div id="equity-concerns" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Equity concerns</h3>
<p>The previous empirical analyses confirm that currently, there are communities left out from the benefit of one of clean energy technologies, PV and EV. This raises an issue on social justice. From the utilitarian perspective, it is more efficient to use limited resources to maximize the global benefits thus, current distribution of clean energy technologies as a result of the present clean energy policies, seems to get along with this principle as opposed to the social justice. In short, current clean energy policies or incentives are based on utilitarian principle. For example, rebates, tax credits, production performance credits, property tax exemptions, and sale tax exemptions are for those who are able to finance solar systems in addition to possessing their own houses. Opportunities to take part in the incentives are hard for those who can’t afford clean energy technologies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>While a number of studies have investigated various aspects of the policies designed to support PV system and EV charger installations, there is still a dearth of studies aimed at investigating the impact of such policies on social equity. Two unanswered questions have emerged: (1) were there certain communities inadvertently left out from incentive opportunities? and (2) do those current policies help to encourage the social equity in clean energy technologies? To answer these questions, the research aims to perform a spatial analysis of the distribution of PV and EV charger installed-buildings in terms of housing and socioeconomic characteristics based on the census tracks of Seattle, WA. In particular, this research aims to explore patterns of the residential (single family and multifamily) regarding PV systems and EV chargers by examining spatial clustering and associations among variables through several data sources. The examined data entails the socioeconomic and housing characteristics based on the American Community Survey of the census.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the City of Seattle open data portal which keeps the records of electrical permits issued between 2003 and 2018 in Seattle. Electrical permits are required when residential houses want to install PV and EV chargers on their properties. The present study employed advanced data mining techniques to identify residential PV and EV charger installation among the data sets. The data include geographical coordinates (latitudes and longitudes), dates of the PV and EV charger installations, and PV and EV charger contractors who installed the systems. Mapping the points of residential PV and EV charger in the region allows to verify a certain pattern in the installations. The densities of the data points, normalized by the density of the total households shows a clustered pattern, where the value means scaled density value.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Map clean energy technologies (PV and EV) to verify distribution patterns</li>
<li>Task 2: Find the latent variables using Factor analysis</li>
<li>Task 3: Verify the suitability of the latent variables using clustering analysis</li>
<li>Task 4: Find the relationship between the distribution patterns and the latent variables using spatial autocorrelation regression model</li>
<li>Task 5: Find the sensitive communities to each latent variable using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<!-- Point patterns could be identified by G estimation which could be compared with complete spatial randomness (CSR). The G estimation function (EDF) of the nearest neighbor distances is defined: di represents the distance from the i-th event to the nearest other event in A and n is the number of points. It simulated with 99 realizations under the null (resampling from n points) and formed the G estimate for each set, and produced Monte Carlo envelopes. The estimates being off the envelopes indicates the distribution of PV and EV chargers is far from randomness. After point data was aggregated to the related census tracks, the data was examined in terms of the socioeconomic and housing characteristics based on the American Community Survey (ACS) of the census (2011 - 2015 ACS 5-Year estimates). The rate of the PV and EV charger installations in each census track is the dependent variable in this study. Rest of variables are the proportions given census tracts. -->
<p>The expected rate of residential PV and EV charger per each census track is estimated based on the total number of housing units in Seattle and its residential PV and EV charger numbers. Standardized Installation Ratio (SIR) is defined by the number of residential PV and EV chargers over the expected number of residential PV and EV chargers given the estimated proportion. In this context, SIR refers to the total number of residential PV and EV charger over the total number of housing units in Seattle. The distribution of each census tract SIR shows a clustered pattern similar to that of the previous point data of residential PV and EV chargers.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SIR_i = \frac{Y_i}{E_i} \]</span></p>
<!-- 
The residential PV and EV charger rate is assumed to be associated with a Poisson count model considering its rare proportion with respect to the denominator (the total housing units) in a census track in addition to the fact that the number of residential PV and EV chargers itself, is count data. The residuals, after fitting the Poisson model, show clustering with the similar pattern of SIR distribution across census tracks. This indicates that there is strong evidence of spatial dependency among the regions in Seattle. -->
<p>A Moran’s I test identified global clustering in the distribution of the rates of residential PV and EV charger with a very small p-value with the test statistic. This confirms that the residential PV and EV charger rate across census tracks is clustered. This clustering trend can be alleviated by fitting a model with appropriate covariates with the similar characteristics. For that, socioeconomic and housing characteristics were examined to identify the most proper covariates. Having verified that there is a spatial pattern in the residential PV and EV charger rate, there might be related or shared factors in the socioeconomic and housing characteristics of the same region. It shows that housing, economy, and social inequality variables pairwise correlations.</p>
<!-- 
Dimension reduction of covariates was performed by a factor analysis in consideration of avoiding multicollinearity. The newly generated factors were fitted to models to estimate the residential PV and EV charger rates. Residuals were checked afterwards to see if there is still a clustered pattern. If there is still a clustered pattern, it means that the model does not address the spatial dependency. The factor analysis identifies the similar variables in terms of housing unit structures (single/multi-family house unit), housing ownership types (rent/owned), economic status (income levels and housing values), and inequality index. Housing unit structures show the similar trend of housing tenure while housing median value, high income class proportion, and household median incomes follow the similar pattern representing economic status. Residential PV and EV charger rates and the factors from the dimension reduction show strong correlations. Generalized log-linear model (GLM) fits the data based on the factors, ML1, ML2 and ML3 without consideration of the spatial autocorrelation. Note that ML3, which was negatively correlated with the PV and EV charger rates, becomes positively correlated after the model fit because predictors, ML1 and ML2 affected ML3 in the model. -->
<p>K-means clustering analysis, afterward, identifies similar regions in terms of socio-economic and housing patterns in census tracks. It should be noted that K-means clustering does not take into account the PV and EV charger rates for defining the Euclidean distance among data points, thus the clustered groups are determined only by the three predictors, ML1, ML2 and ML3. This will help to see the difference between the clustered groups and PV and EV charger rates.</p>
<p>A Poisson lognormal spatial model, especially using BYM2 method, is tested to address any residual clustering issues using Bayesian method, Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), which combines Laplace approximations and numerical integration in a very efficient manner. INLA enables Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) addressing temporal and spatial error terms. An Intrinsic Conditional Auto-Regressive (ICAR) model addressed spatial autocorrelation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_i |\beta_{0},\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\beta_{3},S_i,\epsilon_i &amp; \sim_{ind} \mbox{Poisson}(E_i \mbox{e}^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+\beta_{3}X_{3i}} \mbox{e}^{S_i + \epsilon_i}),\\

S_1,...,S_n | \sigma_s^{2} &amp; \sim ~~~ \mbox{ICAR}(\sigma_s^{2}). 
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used to address the local variation of coefficients of predictors by taking into account the local spatial dependency in order to locate regions more sensitive to each predictor.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Result and Contribution (on going)</h2>
<p>Empirical analyses of residential PV and EV chargers in Seattle, WA, revealed that (1) there is a clustered pattern in the distribution of the clean energy technologies installations, (2) housing stability and economic status explain the uneven distribution, and (3) some neighbors are more sensitive to the economic status and housing stability in terms of installations. The study results revealed social equity issues based on the uneven distribution, i.e., certain communities are underserved for the clean energy technologies. The study results will help policy makers to better support any underserved communities under limited resources (e.g., those who rent houses and have less finance for PV and EV and charger) by devising equitable clean energy policies in response to clean energy technologies.</p>
<p>Current uneven distribution of clean energy technologies are presenting social equity issue. The most significant factors to the uneven distribution were identified: economic status and housing stability. Spatial autocorrelation and clustering issue were addressed by the ICAR model. Furthermore this research found that socio-economic data from Sensus could be used as predictors to estimate the distribution of clean energy technologies for other regions. Finally, sensitive communities to the identified factors were identified for policy makers to address social equity for effective and even distribution of clean energy technologies.</p>
