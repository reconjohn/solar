<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Problem Statement</h2>
<p>A resilient energy supply is important especially during emergency situations when, for example, medical services are in high demand. Furthermore, about 1.1 billion people lack access to electricity and an estimated investment of 52 billion USD per year is needed for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (IEA 2017). Lack of electricity differentially affects vulnerable people (e.g., patients). Hurricane Maria caused additional deaths in Puerto Rico in 2017, especially to those who relied on respirators powered by electricity (Robles et al. 2017). Maria perpetrated the longest blackout in US history, more than 100 days (Irfan 2018). Respiratory patients are more vulnerable to power outages and mortality and respiratory hospital admissions increased significantly during the blackout (Lin et al. 2011). These studies and reports suggest that a resilient power supply is essential to protect those vulnerable communities. To that end, a decentralized energy network has the potential to improve energy accessibility and resilience, and has been increasing in size and use due to efficient end-use appliances and low-cost PV supported by information and communication technologies (ICT) and virtual financial services (Alstone et al. 2015). However, 1.3 billion people still lack access to electricity, and experience barriers to mobilize the decentralized energy networks to local level.</p>
<p>While decentralized energy systems are improving resilience, the intermittent power generation of PV affects reliability of the power supply at the community level. This increases challenges to grid system operators because higher penetration and uneven distribution of PV and EV lead to challenges to the local electrical grid. Thus, access to clean energy technologies not only provide benefits of economy and resilience to communities, but also pose technical challenges to the local grid. First, the incurred costs of grid modernization increases burdens to underserved communities in the form of taxes and electric bills. Second, communities with higher decentralization trends need to address uncertain power generation schedule due to the lack of active generation and demand connectivity. As a result, communities need more diverse and less correlated power sources, energy storage and demand participation. Lastly, an electric network with higher decentralization trends requires improved forecasting technologies and new operating tools to ensure stability and coordination among transmission systems. This study aims to identify which communities are more vulnerable in terms of energy resilience in coming years due to lower access to clean energy technologies. In addition, as installations of PV and EV chargers are expected to increase, this study will also identify technically vulnerable communities which will require system investments.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Literature Review</h2>
<p>Climate change and its impact on urban systems has raised questions of how to improve systems resilience especially related to energy. Energy resilience studies are still at an emerging stage and only a few studies have tried to actually define energy resilience. First, the common definition of resilience is discussed in terms of abilities in preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation to stressors. Sharifi and Yamagata (2016) addressed resilience in sustainability related dimensions: availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability. They found “preparation” in resilience ability and “availability” in sustainable dimensions to be the most critical considerations to addressing energy resilience. They added that “preparation” involves early adoption of planning and design measures to avoid potential disruptions in that preparation is most effective to improve resilience. Furthermore, they argue that reserve margins, diverse energy sources, and monitoring systems could improve “availability” of energy services (Sharifi and Yamagata 2016).</p>
<p>Vulnerability is defined as being at risk of having limited capacity to protect one’s interests. It is mainly interpreted in connection with weakness, dependency, powerlessness, deficiency, and passivity (Gilson 2013). This implicit bias leads to a problem in ethical response as it entails negative connotation (Gilson 2013). Furthermore, vulnerability could be discussed in two sources - “inherent” and “situational” (Mackenzie 2013). Inherent vulnerability is defined as peoples’ neediness and dependence on others. This applies to energy dependency in modern society because energy is essential to the basic human needs to sustain life. Situational vulnerability is context-dependent such that the negative impact of energy poverty on a certain community, would be different from the impact on other communities, depending upon social, political, economic, and environmental situations. For example, effects of hurricane would be lower in a community with more resilient energy systems. Thus, it is important to discuss characteristics of resilient energy systems in terms of energy dependency and social, political, economic, and environmental situational conditions.</p>
<p>Community resilience may increase due to integrated energy diversity and decentralization of energy supply. Two emerging characteristics for energy resilience were presented by Lin and Bie (2016): integrated energy system (IES) and distributed energy resources (DERs). IES features inter-dependency and diversity while DERs represent energy sources spread across regions by being decentralized using technologies such as micro-grids. Integration of interdependent infrastructures such as energy, water, and telecommunication, can also lead to better mitigation in response to extreme weather (Zimmerman et al. 2017). This study suggested that when systems are combined, the complexity can become characterized and the emergent behavior of the system becomes hard to be expected. In the study, two measures for energy resilience were introduced: hardware hardening and operational resilience strategies. Hardware hardening is costly and influences a limited part of the whole system leading to less effectiveness. On the other hand, increasing diversity of energy supply, would increase system resilience (Zimmerman et al. 2017).</p>
<p>Understanding inter-dependencies of infrastructures are essential to address vulnerability. For instance, Wang and Reed (2017) showed that inter-dependencies in infrastructures are important to a system resilience. Furthermore, their study suggested that using community-level micro-grids would increase robustness of the energy system in addition to hardening the structure of power delivery components and increasing power generation redundancy. Furthermore, homogeneous and sole energy production systems can not only adversely affect communities with the lack of diverse energy supply, but also harm the social and environmental value of the built environment. For example, Shahidehpour et al. (2017) suggested centralized energy production may have contributed to vulnerability of the current urban form because most subsystems of human activities were relying on the sole energy production. Thus, controllable and islandable micro-grid systems (decentralized systems) would improve the resilience of power grids in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Energy transition to decarbonization resulting from climate change requires demand side participation, battery storage, and decentralization in response to variable renewables. Without consideration of the cost-reliability tradeoff, going 100% renewable would produce higher energy cost and lower reliability due to the characteristics of variability of renewable energy sources. For example, higher uptake of PV is a challenge to network operators to keep enough capacity and voltage for stable energy supply (Balta-Ozkan et al. 2015). These reliability issues in supply-demand balance result from the fact that renewables do not have active generation and demand connected (ESIG 2019). This affects energy planning and operation. Energy planning takes into account resource adequacy to ensure the demands of capacities (system, local and flexible) are met. Power plants get paid by providing those capacities. As more distributed power sources are deployed, more diverse and less correlated power sources, storage and demand participation are needed. While adequacy is a planning challenge, flexibility and the provision of energy services are an operational challenge that requires probabilistic mindset, distributed energy storage, data analytics and coordination between systems. Furthermore, with respect to the market, price volatility due to variable renewables requires investment for flexibility. In addition, voltage and frequency control should be managed carefully as renewables are non-synchronous with no inherent inertial response. Change in the synchronous nature of an electricity system will affect the core technology of the current power infrastructure with its control and protection (ESIG 2019).</p>
<p>Deregulation may lead to less grid reliability with increased competition, which prevented some states from market restructuring or deregulation (Michaud 2018). Likewise, increasing renewables in the grid affects grid reliability as well raising the issue of hosting capacity. Hosting capacity is the amount of distributed PV (DPV) that can be added to distribution system before control changes or system upgrades are required to safely and reliably integrate additional DPV. A number of factors influencing hosting capacity of a DPV system require consideration, such as whether advanced inverter settings are utilized, the system size, and where it is located on the circuit. The characteristics of DPV system includes the location and time-varying behavior of all distributed energy resources and the existing equipment on a circuit. As the system configuration evolves over time depending on investments made by utility companies, DPV owners or developers, distribution planning practices are important especially when upgrades or other mitigation against the impacts of having more renewables are required (Dubey et al. 2015).</p>
<p>EV features battery storage and demand side participation with the grid because it could be employed for load balancing via smart charging with Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology. Yamagata et al. (2016) tried to analyze several algorithms to find the optimal clustering of communities in terms of self-sufficiency, sharing cost, and stability. The concept of V2C (vehicle to community) was introduced in the study with respect to tradeoff between implementation and maintenance cost, and electricity self-sufficient for community based energy networks. In this context, DER adopter analysis of different technologies (PV, EV, and HVAC) was discussed by comparison of distribution patterns and aggregating scales (Heymann et al. 2019). The authors suggested to consider uneven distribution for electricity network planning with respect to the investment plan for EV and PV with different distribution patterns. They argued that the difference of EV and PV adoption for energy policy design in consideration of synergies and distributional justice should be considered as it will help design DER support schemes for maximizing penetration and reducing network expansion costs (Heymann et al. 2019).</p>
<p>Furthermore, PV self-consumption will lower medium voltage distribution grid losses and investments in cables and transformers (Litjens et al. 2018). In addition, overloading may occur on medium voltage grids due to the increase of PV, EV, and electric heating (Sijm 2014). In this regard, higher levels of PV self-consumption may decrease stress on the grid thus ease integration of PV in the existing infrastructure (van der Kam and van Sark 2015). This study suggested self-consumption by energy storage and demand side management (DSM) by establishment of the geographical misfit between EV and PV diffusion and the impact on energy systems. They found EV diffusion lags behind PV diffusion led to different supply and demand patterns for different regions which require different grid architectures (van der Kam and van Sark 2015).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>Installations of PV and EV chargers are expected to increase and lead to challenges to the local electrical grid with respect to the reliability of power supply. To that end, it is important to identify vulnerable communities in terms of rates of technology penetrations in different communities. The emerging questions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are predicted future trends of diffusion of PV and EV in each community?</li>
<li>Where are technically vulnerable communities with respect to rapid increases of PV and EV?</li>
</ol>
<p>For these questions, this study aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict diffusion of clean energy technologies in consideration of socioeconomic, built environment characteristics and peer effects. The predicted diffusion will identify socially and technically vulnerable communities in terms of diffusion of clean energy technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Verify the importance of identifying communities with higher decentralization trends</li>
<li>Task 2: Identify methods to best predict the diffusion of clean energy technologies in consideration of the identified factors: socioeconomic, built environment characteristics and peer effects</li>
<li>Task 3: Develop a robust prediction model to identify vulnerable communities with regards to clean energy technology distribution</li>
<li>Task 4: Validate the prediction model in case studies and evaluate the impact of the different diffusion rates of clean energy technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on features such as socioeconomic and built environment characteristics and peer effects, the development of a prediction model will involve linear regression models with Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic net regressions. Regularization is necessary to avoid overfitting which leads to a higher variation when applying the model to other data sets. It is bias-variance tradeoff that a localized model is hard to be generalizable. Regularization helps to avoid overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. A penalty term prevents model parameters (feature weights) from becoming larger. The best model can be identified in terms of accuracy and root square mean error (RSME).</p>
<p>There are several machine learning algorithms available for this study. For example, a support vector machine (SVM) separates data using a hyper-plane which is defined by support vectors or the nearest observations. Depending on the tolerance of margin violations, there are soft and hard margin classifications. An SVM regressor with Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel is a special form of SVM that has higher dimensional feature vectors. There are several kernels such as polynomial and sigmoid. The benefit of kernel is that the classifier can be flexible enough to separate data without involving additional features. A random forest model features entailing randomness when training a model, which promotes diversity, leading to a better model performance. This algorithm is an ensemble of decision trees that try to separate data into homogeneous groups by setting thresholds. Extra-trees even randomize the thresholds to have a more diverse environment for the model to be trained. A gradient boosting model fits data and then keeps fitting the residuals in sequence by adding predictors. These algorithms have several hyper-parameters that could be searched for the best model performances by using modules such as randomizedSearchCV and gridsearchcv. All the models could be fitted with the optimal hyper-parameters found.</p>
<p>Gradient descent is a generic optimization algorithm in machine learning. For example, to minimize a cost function <span class="math inline">\(f(\theta)\)</span>, we start with an arbitrary point <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{0}\)</span> and repeat the algorithm until it is near the optimal point. The cost function could be different depending upon the context. The goal is the find the weights (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) which minimize the cost function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\theta^{k + 1} = \theta^{k} - \eta_k\nabla f(\theta^{k}) 
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(\theta^{k})\)</span> = the direction of steepest descent of f at a point <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(\eta_k\)</span> = “step size” or “learning rate.” <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{k+1}\)</span> has a better value than <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{k}\)</span>. With each step of Gradient descent, the value function gets better. Eventually, the algorithm converges to a local minimum.</p>

### Hosting capacity 

Hosting capacity is the amount of DPV that can be added to distribution system before control changes or system upgrades are required to safely and reliably integrate additional DPV. 

Factors to consider: 

* The characteristics of the DPV system, such as whether advanced inverter settings are utilized, the system size, and where it is located on the circuit,
* The location and time-varying behavior of all distributed energy resources on the circuit, such as distributed storage,
* The existing equipment on a circuit at any given time, which will evolve over time depending on investments made by utilities and DPV owners or developers, and
* The distribution planning practices used by the utility—especially how they determine when upgrades or other mitigations are required.
