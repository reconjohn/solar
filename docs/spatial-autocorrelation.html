<p>Q2. Given that charging stations and solar generation sites are spatial points, discuss how you will address spatial structure (i.e., potential spatial autocorrelation) in your data and analysis.</p>
<div id="spatial-perspective-in-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Spatial perspective in the data</h2>
<p>Darmofal (2015) argued that units often interact with each other and affect each other’s behavior. This interaction is mainly from spatial proximity in that units that are more geographically proximate are more likely to interact with each other. He added that units often exhibit similar outcomes as a result of shared environmental influences even if there is no physical interaction. In this regard, spatial analyses are important to address the spatial proximity and dependent characteristics in a study area. Currently, several spatial methods are available due to the development of computing power such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and data availability with possible collection of multiple spatial data sets at different geographical scales.</p>
<p>There are 3 data types representing spatial characteristics: (1) area, (2) point, and (3) geostatistics because observations are collected in forms of points (i.e., point or geostatistical data) or regions (i.e., area data) located in space. Area data are carried out by aggregation over a defined boundary such as an administrative unit (e.g., census tract). Point data exhibit the actual configuration of points over the study area. On the other hand, geostatistical data represent the characteristics of the interest subjects at residential locations as points. In this regard, it is important to design how to collect data because it affects the spatial characteristics in a spatial analysis. Sampling mechanism is addressing how data are collected. For example, survey data with a complex design would need weighted analyses if the data are not a random sample in space. If the data are not a simple random sample, clustering patterns won’t make sense in regard to the spatial structure in the analysis due to the involved bias in the data collection.</p>
<p>The research data include geographical coordinates (i.e., latitudes and longitudes) of photovoltaic systems (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) charger installations. Since the data are complete enumeration, clustering analyses will verify distributional patterns of the clean energy technologies by mapping the points of PV or EV chargers in the region. This will verify certain spatial patterns in the installations. Furthermore, by aggregating the point data by a census tract (CT), spatial regression models could be constructed to find the relationship between the installations and CT’s socio-economic characteristics, which are normally available in the CT level from American Community Survey (ACS).</p>
<p>As aggregation of polygon is needed for the analysis due to the data availability of socio-economic characteristics, the point data will be aggregated by a CT level. Since the socio-economic characteristics are human related, aggregation in the CT level, the political boundary, may capture the local socio-economic characteristics. But if it is about environmental features, then it would not be the case. However, data aggregation may lead to ecological fallacy where conclusions based on group-level data are different from those based on an analysis which uses individual-level data. Furthermore, aggregation of data may also lead to modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), where the inconsistency of results under different geographical configurations exists. MAUP consists of two components depending upon the different levels of spatial resolution and regroupings: the scale effect and the zoning effect (Dharshing 2017).</p>
</div>
<div id="clustering-and-spatial-autocorrelation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Clustering and spatial autocorrelation</h2>
<p>Spatial clustering presents a local spatial variation, which suggests spatial autocorrelation. There is spatial autocorrelation in a variable if observations that are closer to each other in space have related values (Tobler’s Law). In other words, spatial autocorrelation is a dependence among areas related to the geographical positions.</p>
<p>Moran’s I statistic (Moran 1948) is the most widely used method of testing for spatial autocorrelation, or spatial dependencies. If no spatial dependencies in the area exist, the test statistic would be close to zero (it ranges from -1 to 1). If the value is positive and close to 1, the interested area presents clustering. On the other hand, it would present dispersion if the value is negative and close to -1. Since the research is concerned about measuring the similarity of nearby features, Moran’s I will be used because the measure will indicate that similar values occur together. However, it does not indicate whether any cluster is composed of high or low values, but General G statistic will do. In short, Moran’s I will tell whether the data is clustered in general or autocorrelated while General G statistic will tell whether there are clusters of high and low values.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are other statistics to test the local spatial dependencies. For example, Hotspot analysis (Getis - Ord Gi*) compares the neighborhood cluster to the global within the study area. If the neighborhood where the feature is located in is significantly different from the average global study area, then the individual feature becomes a hot spot. Since it is by means of neighborhood, not the feature itself, a feature with a value close to the global mean value, could be still a hot spot. In addition, local Moran’s I (i.e., cluster and outlier analysis) is similar to the hot spot statistic except that it compares a feature with its neighbor.</p>

<p class="caption">An example of mapping point data showing clustering in Seattle</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, a semivariogram can tell a spatial dependence in unequally-spaced data. Points close together tend to be similar thus, the variance of the pairwise difference would be small while it will increase as the distance increases. At some distance, the points would be independent to each other. For example, there would be a certain distance that the model levels out. The distance where the model first flattens out is called “range”. Sample locations separated by distances closer than the range are spatially autocorrelated while locations farther than the range are not. Furthermore, empirical distribution function (EDF) such as G function can also identify point patterns with respect to complete spatial randomness (CSR). The G estimation function of the nearest neighbor distances is defined as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{G}(d) = \frac{\#(d_i \leq d)}{n} \]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span> represents the distance from the i-th point to the nearest point and n is the number of points. It is simulated with several realizations under the null by resampling from n points and formed the G estimate for each set, and produced Monte Carlo envelopes (i.e., CSR). The estimates being off the evelopes indicates that the distribution is far from randomness.</p>

<div id="spatial-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Spatial regression</h2>
<p>Once clustering is verified in the data, spatial autocorrelation should be addressed. Spatial regression models incorporate spatial effects, which define cross-sectional dependence presenting geographical similarity. This similarity is normally two dimensional and multidirectional. Since the proposed research is interested in the spatial pattern of the clean energy technologies in consideration of distributional energy justice, leveraging spatial dependencies in the analysis will address the spatial autocorrelation in estimating regression models.</p>
<p>Ignoring spatial dependence leads to biased and inconsistent estimate and loss of efficiency (Balta et al. 2015). In general, a linear regression model won’t work if there is a spatial dependence in the error terms or regression residuals. This is because ordinary least squares (OLS) requires the error terms have constant variance and are uncorrelated each other. Furthermore, one of the regression assumptions is independence of observations. In other words, the observations should be independent of each other as well as the regression residuals. If this assumption is violated, the coefficient estimates could be wrong and we get inaccurate estimates of the coefficients, and the error term contains spatial dependencies. Error should not be distinguishable from random noise.</p>
<p>We need to specify a rule for determining the neighbors of each area to address the spatial autocorrelation. The common rule is to assign two areas as neighbors if they share a common boundary especially in the situation where all regions are similar in size and arranged in a regular pattern. The other ways to define neighbors are to take the distance such that regions within the distance become neighbors; or to consider cultural similarity. With an n x n spatial weight matrix (n is the number of observations), a vector of the means of the responses of the neighbor observations is created. This weight matrix is used in the estimation of spatial regression and the calculation of Moran’s I. The spatial weight matrix, then, becomes the element of the spatial regression models as a “lag” term, which is a specification at nearby locations.</p>
<p>Mainly two models are considered to address the issue of spatial autocorrelation: (1) simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) and (2) conditional autoregressive (CAR) models mostly in econometrics and epidemiology studies (Banerjee at al. 2014). SAR specifies its variance-covariance matrix with more than first order dependencies so that this model is more suitable for a global spatial autocorrelation. SAR has three different forms depending on where the autoregressive process occurs including spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM) and spatial Durbin model (SDM). For example, Graziano et al. (2019) addressed spatial spillovers regarding the built environment and jurisdictional boundaries using a SAR model, a special case of the general spatial Durbin model (SDM). Dharshing (2017) examined economic factors, socio-demographic and attitudinal adopter characteristics, settlement structure, and spillover effects between neighboring counties using SAR and SEM. The typical SDM equation is as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y = \rho WY+X\beta+WX\theta+u
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is a spatial autoregressive parameter, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a spatial lag in the independent variables.</p>
<p>SLM and SME is the special forms of SDM. For example, SDM becomes simplified into SLM when <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is zero, while it becomes SEM when <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> becomes - <span class="math inline">\(\rho\beta\)</span> (Balta et al. 2015).</p>
</div>
<div id="conditional-spatial-model" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Conditional spatial model</h2>
<p>CAR assumes that only the neighbors influence the concerned feature by obeying the spatial Markov property. Since CAR features local spatial autocorrelation, this research will use an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR), a subclass of CAR models based on a Gaussian Markov Random Field (MRF). MRF decides the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> given the known values of the neighboring random variables <span class="math inline">\(S_j\)</span> (Rue and Held 2005). ICAR assumes that spatial random effect follows a normal distribution with the mean of the neighbors’ random effects and the variance inversely proportional to the number of neighbors as follows (Beasg et al. 1991).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ S_i |S_j, J\in ne(i) \sim \mbox{N}(\overline{S_i},\frac{\sigma_s^{2}}{m_i}) \]</span>
where, ne(i) is the set of neighbors of area i, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{S_i}\)</span> is the mean of the spatial random effects of the neighbors, and <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> is the number of neighbors. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s^{2}\)</span> is a conditional variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ var(S_i) = \sigma_s^{2} \]</span>
Since ICAR has a single parameter to decide the magnitude of variance and strength of dependence, a non-spatial random effect (i.e., IID) should be included in the ICAR random effect. This model was known as the BYM model introduced by Besag et al. (1991). This ICAR will be added to a lognormal model to allow spatial dependence in the model.</p>

<div id="poisson-log-linear-model" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Poisson log-linear model</h2>
<p>The expected installation rate of PV or EV charger in a CT is estimated by the total number of housing units in the region and the number of installations. Standardized Installation Ratio (SIR) is defined by the number of PV or EV chargers (<span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>) over the expected number of PV or EV chargers (<span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>) given the estimated proportion as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SIR_i = \frac{Y_i}{E_i} \]</span></p>
<p>PV or EV charger rates are assumed to be associated with a Poisson count model considering its rare proportion with respect to the denominator (i.e., the total housing units) in a CT. In addition, since the number of PV or EV chargers are count data, a Poission log-linear model will be constructed as follows.</p>

<p>A Poisson log-linear spatial model, especially using BYM2 method, will be tested to address any residual clustering issues using Bayesian method, an integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), which combines Laplace approximations and numerical integration in a very efficient manner. While Markov chain Monte Calro (MCMC) had been used, INLA is simpler and has a computation benefit for computing posterior summary measures. INLA enables Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to address temporal and spatial error terms with ICAR for spatial autocorrelation. INLA takes into account spatial dependencies and lognormal independent variance across CTs (Rue et al. 2009). The developed hierarchical or random effects model is as follows.</p>

<p>A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model will also address the spatial autocorrelation in a local level by changing the coefficient of the covariates without involvement of the explicit spatial term (Gollini et al. 2015). GWR also presents the variance of the coefficients by fitting a regression equation to every feature in the dataset. This becomes possible by specifying the neighborhood type and neighborhood selection method. GWR identifies sensitivities of concerned covariates by identifying the coefficients of the covariates (Fotheringham et al. 2003). The model is as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
logY(s) = logE(s)+ \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(s)X_1(s)+\beta_{2}(s)X_2(s)+\epsilon(s)

<p>The research will first, test the regression residuals for spatial autocorrelation, using Moran’s I for area data and G estimate for point data. If significant spatial autocorrelation exists and the spatial dependencies are significant, spatial models which takes spatial dependencies into account will be used (i.e., Poisson log-linear model and GWR).</p>
