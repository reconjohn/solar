<div id="reliability-of-energy-supply" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Reliability of energy supply</h3>
<p>Reliability of energy supply has proven to be important especially during emergency situations when, for example, medical services are in high demand. Furthermore, about 1.1 billion people lack access to electricity and 52 billion USD annual investment is needed for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (IEA 2017). Lack of electricity affects more vulnerable people such as patients. Hurricane Maria caused additional deaths in Puerto Rico, especially to those who relied on respirators powered by electricity in 2017 (Robles et al. 2017). It is known that Maria incurred the longest blackout with more than 100 days in the US history (Irfan 2018). Respiratory patients are more vulnerable to power outages that mortality and respiratory hospital admissions increased significantly during the blackout (Lin et al. 2011). These studies and reports show that reliable power supply is essential to those vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>To address climate change which is affecting people, it is necessary to have reliable energy services evenly distributed to all over the communities, particularly to those more vulnerable. Decentralized energy system is more reliable in terms of energy access and the low carbon challenges (Goldthau 2014). For example, micro-grids (decentralized energy system) at community level lead to more robust power systems (Wang and Reed 2017). Integration of interdependent infrastructures including, but not limited to energy, water, and telecommunication, also bring out the better mitigation in response to extreme weather (Zimmerman et al. 2017).</p>
</div>
<div id="definition-of-resilience" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Definition of resilience</h3>
<p>Climate change and its impact on urban systems have raised questions of how to improve resilient systems especially the ones related to energy. Some of researchers introduced indexes related to resilience for analyses, and the others created mathematical functions to interpret the current phenomenon and simulated to prove their hypotheses. Energy resilience research is still at its emerging stage that a few literatures have tried to define energy resilience. First, the common definition of resilience could be discussed in terms of resilience abilities (preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation). It is also addressed in terms of sustainability related dimensions (availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability). “Preparation” in resilience ability and “availability” in sustainable dimension are considered to be the most critical to address energy resilience (Sharifi and Yamagata 2016). “Preparation” involves early adoption of planning and design measures to avoid potential disruptions. Preparation measure is known to be the most effective to improve the resilience. Furthermore, reserve margins, diverse energy sources, and monitoring systems could improve “availability” of energy services.</p>
</div>
<div id="definition-of-vulnerability" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Definition of vulnerability</h3>
<p>Vulnerability could be defined as being at risk of having limited capacity of power to protect one’s interest. Vulnerability is, however, mainly interpreted in connection with weakness, dependency, powerlessness, deficiency, and passivity. This implicit bias leads to a problem in ethical response as it entails negative connotation (Gilson 2013). Vulnerability could be interpreted in two sources - “inherent” and “situational” (Mackenzie 2013). Our neediness and dependence on others incur inherent vulnerability. This applies to energy dependency in the modern society because energy is essential to the basic human needs to sustain life. Situational vulnerability is context dependent such that negative impact of energy poverty on a certain community, would be different from the impact on other communities, depending upon social, political, economic, and environmental situations. For example, effects of a same hurricane would be less in a community, which has more resilient energy systems. Thus, it is necessary to discuss characteristics of resilient energy systems in terms of energy dependency and situational conditions (social, political, economic, and environmental).</p>
</div>
<div id="characteristics-for-resilient-energy-systems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Characteristics for resilient energy systems</h3>
<p>Community resilience could benefit from integrated energy diversity and decentralization in terms of reliable energy supply. Two emerging characteristics for energy resilience were presented: integrated energy system (IES) and distributed energy resources (DERs) (Lin and Bie 2016). IES is related to interdependency and diversity of systems while DERs represent several renewable energy sources spread across regions. DERs could be interpreted as decentralized energy systems such as micro-grids. When systems are combined, the complexity becomes characterized and the emergent behavior of the system is hard to be expected. In the study, two measures for energy resilience were introduced: hardware hardening and operational resilience strategies. Hardware hardening happens to be costly and influences only a limited part of the whole system that is less effective. On the other hand, increasing diversity of energy supply, would increase the system resilience.</p>
</div>
<div id="integrated-energy-system-ies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Integrated energy system (IES)</h3>
<p>Understanding interdependencies of infrastructures are essential to address vulnerability. For instance, a study shows that interdependencies in infrastructures including energy, are important to a system resilience, and space and time are critical to assess hazard impact of interdependent lifeline infrastructures (Wang and Reed 2017). Furthermore, the study suggested that micro-grid at the community level, would increase robustness of the energy system in addition to hardening structure of power delivery components and increasing power generation redundancy. Robustness for power and telecommunication infrastructure was modeled in this study, in terms of resilience (Purple infra – human; Green infra – social, biological, hydrological, circulatory, and metabolic; Gray infra – lifelines; and modeling of interdependencies). Using state wide data, the study models the inoperability in terms of time (model parameters chosen by the goodness of fit). Time to recovery model estimates resource allocation pre-event. It found that peak wind speed and the corresponding parameters are not significant. Fragility models were developed by logistic regression. The same model for power was applied to telecommunication. Combined model (power and telecommunication) with the fragility model and single degree of freedom system (SDOF), may predict the restoration after hurricanes. Those models could be used to predict performance of the combined infrastructure systems in response to future storms. This study argues that social science involvement may be necessary to investigate from the community perspectives in addition to the infrastructure operators’ perspectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-energy-resources-ders" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.6</span> Distributed energy resources (DERs)</h3>
<p>Homogeneous and a sole energy production system not only adversely affects communities due to the lack of reliable energy supply, but also harms the social and environmental value of the built environment. Decentralization of energy production and supply has played an important role to resilient community as it is more robust in response to disruptions. For example, a study shows controllable and islandable micro-grid systems (decentralized systems) would improve the resiliency of power grids in extreme conditions (Shahidehpour et al. 2017). On the other hand, centralized energy production may have contributed to vulnerability of the current urban form as most of subsystems of human activities are relying on the sole energy production. The more dependent to a sole energy production, the more vulnerable a system would face interruptions.</p>
<p>Decentralized energy network, also, has enhanced the energy accessibility, and has been increasing due to efficient end-use appliance and low-cost photovoltaic supported by ICT (mobile phone) and virtual financial services (Alstone et al. 2015). There are still 1.3 billion people who currently lack access to electricity, and some barriers to mobilize the decentralized energy networks to local level. Governance of energy infrastructures in connection with polycentric governances will promote resilient energy systems (Goldthau 2014). It is because polycentric governances promote decentralized energy systems. Social science would be helpful to provide the reliable energy services as polycentric governance is critically related to socio-economic actors.</p>
<p>The investment of off-grid, one of the decentralized energy systems, however, features Unfavorable risk-return profiles and small investment volumes. Spatial diversity in a portfolio can reduce investment risks of private investments on resilient energy systems. Potential aggregation of small-scale renewable energy to investment is promising in that spatial diversification is helpful for derisking. Classification of risks, quantitative estimation of cost and derisking effects for aggregation of small-scale investments will help attracting private investment on off-grid. Barriers to private investment are financial, institutional and policy, and technical. Market risk could be decreased by portfolio with different geographies or industries. Systematic assessment is necessary for derisking related to regional disasters, policy change and regional industry (Malhotra et al. 2017).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="methodology-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>Impact of higher decentralization trend of PV and EV on Grid operation will be identified by intensive literature review. Importance of identifying the communities with higher decentralization trend will be verified. Methods to best predict the diffusion of clean energy technologies will be developed in consideration of the identified significant factors in the previous chapters such as socio-economic characteristics, policy interruption and peer effect. Finally a robust prediction model will be developed to identify those vulnerable communities in regard to clean energy technology distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="expected-contribution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Expected contribution</h2>
<p>The most expected vulnerable communities are identified due to the higher diffusion rate. A prediction model will be suggested to estimate the future impact of addtion of clean energy technologies such as PV and EV. Policy makers and utilities can refer to this result to plan their investment on distribution systems and scalable renewable energy infrastructures. Identifying the most vulnerable communities will help independent system operator (ISO) to take appropriate actions.</p>
