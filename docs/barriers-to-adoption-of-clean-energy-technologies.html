<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Barriers to Adoption of Clean Energy Technologies</h1>
<p>Q3. Efforts to promote clean energy technologies (PV systems and EV chargers) in the residential built environment can face different types of barriers, such as technology barriers, financial barriers, political &amp; regulatory barriers, market barriers, etc. Based on the existing literature, discuss the implications of various barriers to the advancement of PV systems and EV chargers in the residential built environment, by each type.</p>
<div id="introduction-4" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Clean energy policies have aimed at increasing adoption of clean energy technologies by mostly focusing on financial incentives and setting renewable energy targets (Strupeit and Palm 2016). However, diffusion of the technologies is not only by incentives, but also by removal of barriers and transaction costs (Strupeit and Palm 2016). Thus, it is important to identify barriers to adoption of clean energy technologies. Below overall barriers of mainly residential photovoltaic systems (hereafter PV) will be discussed followed by technical, financial, regulatory, market, and customer related barriers. Then, particular adoption barriers to shared solar and residential electric vehicle (hereafter EV) chargers will be discussed.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Technical barriers</h2>
<p>Higher penetration of clean energy technologies has been resisted by utilities and system operators (ISO). This is because higher adoption of clean energy technologies will cause the electric demand to become more unstable by demanding more power plants back-ups due to the stochastic or intermittent characteristics of renewables (e.g., PV) and mismatching time coincidence between generation and load including EV charging (Brown 2016). This reliability issue causes running additional generating units to have a certain amount of operating reserve. However, It is controversial to quantify the value of reliability as the consequence of outage is context-dependent. The lost value includes not only monetary losses but also loss of comfort, and opportunity costs which are quite subjective. Most of residential electricity peak demand is evening while PV production reaches its peak in the afternoon. This off-peak characteristics of renewables are adding burden to utilities. Therefore, even if there is a certain amount of electricity generated from PV, they don’t add value on due to the off-peak generation.</p>
<p>The limit of the grid capacity is another technical barrier to adoption of clean energy technologies. Hosting capacity is the amount of distributed PV (DPV) that can be added to distribution system before control changes or system upgrades are required to safely and reliably integrate additional DPV. A number of factors influencing hosting capacity of a DPV system require several considerations, such as whether advanced inverter settings are utilized, the system size, and where it is located on the circuit. It includes the location and time-varying behavior of all distributed energy resources and the existing equipment on a circuit. As the system configuration evolves over time depending on investments made by utility companies, for DPV owners or developers, distribution planning practices are important especially when upgrades or other mitigation to the impact of the adoption are required (Dubey et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Furthermore, higher adoption of clean energy technologies makes the balance between supply and demand of electricity unstable. This is because higher demand leads to outage due to the lower frequency while lower demand leads to higher frequency. Generators are also limited to operating in a certain range of frequencies. In general generators feature mechanical inertia which acts like a shock absorber to outage or frequency drop. This helps electricity being reliable against any interruptions at no additional cost. Since electricity from PV lacks this feature, more back-up reserves are required to offset this risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="financial-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Financial barriers</h2>
<p>High upfront cost is the barrier to adoption of clean energy technologies (Allen et al. 2008, Scarpa et al. 2010). Shih et al. (2011) also added that upfront cost and long payback are the barriers to adoption because economic viability is one of the main drivers to adoption. Mah et al. (2018) also argued that high upfront cost and long payback in addition to the availability of subsidies are the barriers to urban PV adoption. Furthermore, transaction costs (including costs for permission, administration and information obtainment) and accessibility to loans are the other barriers to adoption (Strupeit and Palm 2016). In particular, low and moderate income (LMI) households have a disadvantage to have access to solar loan due to the low credit scores (NREL 2018). Access to loan will promote the PV adoption through PV ownership. For example, in Germany, the most common business model for PV is the ownership model due to the profit from Feed-in Tarrifs (FiTs) and the low-interest loans (Strupeit and Palm 2016).</p>
</div>
<div id="political-regulatory-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Political &amp; regulatory barriers</h2>
<p>Government policies including regulations and financial supports such as grants, incentives, and tax credits are important to increase adoption of clean energy technologies and could be barriers if not well designed. This is because such policies affect the electricity markets in addition to how fast the distributed energy resources spread and how those transitions affect utilities in revenue. As a result, many states are working on reviews of rate designs such as modifying credit rates for the surplus electricity back to the grid, increasing fixed charges, adding demand charges, and allowing shared solar programs (NRRI 2019).</p>
<p>For example, California legislated net energy metering (NEM) paired with storage program to increase adoption such that facilities paired with storage can be exempt from interconnection application fees and distribution upgrade costs. Furthermore, California attracts customers to join NEM paired with storage program by introducing Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) where customers are eligible to receive incentives depending on project size. However, there are some regulations to limit the size of the storage devices so that the grid could still be protected from the massive changes. For example, storage devices larger than 10 kW is required to have a maximum output power no larger than 150% of the NEM generator’s maximum output capacity (CESA 2018). NEM paired with storage benefits customers more as storage gives more flexibility of electricity consumption while there are still barriers for pairing storage to NEM such as higher upfront cost and uncertain policy changes.</p>
<p>Complex process such as permission, vested interests against new energy options are the other barriers to adoption (Mah et al. 2018). This is because permission process is a part of soft costs of PV installation including pre-construction engineering, marketing, and installation labor (Seel at al. 2014). Furthermore, Seel at al. (2014) argued that higher soft costs including complex administration process in the US compared to Germany, had been a barrier to PV adoption. In this regard, policies have to focus on streamlining and facilitation of legal-administrative processes (Strupeit and Palm 2016).</p>
</div>
<div id="market-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Market barriers</h2>
<p>The electricity market has been changed mainly due to the involvement of local business and individual consumers to the market. First, the Public Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978 led the local small business to enter the market by enabling power producers to be independent from utilities. Thus, utilities could only deal with transmission and distribution (T&amp;D), operation, maintenance, and customer billing while customers can directly contact with independent power producers (IPP) (Mithcaud 2018). As a result, this allowed the local small clean energy business to enter the market which may benefits the local economy.</p>
<p>Second, NEM makes it possible for the individual customers to join the markets. As a result, NEM has significantly affected PV adoption through influencing the market by giving credits to customers for generation of electricity from their own distributed system (Augustine and McGavisk 2016). Furthermore, virtual NEM credits multiple customers to offset the electrical load they consumed by electricity generated from a single or multiple renewable energy systems that they subscribed. Customers could benefit from virtual NEM by participating programs such as shared solar by subscription to the program, leasing, or owning the solar system (Augustine 2016).</p>
<p>One of the market barriers are its higher dependence on government policies because government energy policy affects the markets by regulating monopolies and energy stakeholders. As a result, the government policies may incur misplaced incentives, unpriced costs, and difficult access to finance (Mah et al. 2018). For example, government incentives including tax credits, FiTs, and NEM have affected adoption of clean energy technologies. Poruschi and Ambrey (2019) suggested that FiTs are related to more PV installation trends. This is because FiTs attract more installations due to the financial benefits. Likewise, NEM has an economic benefit increasing PV adoption. For example, curtailment of NEM in Nevada had solar contractors discouraged and ending up leaving the market resulting in a drastic fall in residential PV installation in the following year (Muro 2016).</p>
<p>Utilities has been resistant to some clean energy policies such as net energy metering (NEM) in favor of residential PV and EV chargers. This is because utilities responsible for the grid operation and maintenance will have increasing burden to maintain the electric infrastructure due to losing the overall load or demand as clean energy technologies are distributed in a local level. In addition, centralized distribution systems need high upfront cost for large transmission and distribution (T &amp; D) infrastructure. However, NEM may help to eliminate transmission and line losses, and even stabilize the local grid since distributed energy systems will lead to reduction in demand (Michaud 2018). Michaud (2018) added that it also enables a smoother electricity demand curve allowing utilities to manage peak demand better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Energy and Environmental Economics (2016) analyzed that NEM enables utilities to reduce their overall costs of providing services through avoided costs which represents the benefit a distributed energy resource provides to the grid. The components of the avoided cost are energy generation, distribution loses, ancillary services, transmission capacity, distribution capacity, and system capacity. In addition, if carbon tax comes into play for reduction of air pollution, having more NEM in the grid would be more economical (CESA 2018).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the other concern about whether NEM would lead to the net benefit or loss to ratepayers. Some studies concluded that NEM does not impose a significant cost to ratepayers who are not taking part in NEM. For example, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (2016) suggested the impacts of rooftop and commercial PV on average retail rates would be modest. In general, NEM would not affect ratepayers as much while it is still arguable about how this change affects utilities in terms of not only economy, but also technological issues such as system reliability and security.</p>
</div>
<div id="consumer-related-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Consumer-related barriers</h2>
<p>Social acceptance such as community involvement and information gaps are the consumer-related barriers (Mah et al. 2018, Shih et al. 2011). First, Noll et al. (2014) claimed that information needs to come from trusted sources for consumers’ decision making to adopt PV. Furthermore, van der Kam et al. (2018) argued that adoption patterns are determined by the spread of information among consumers. In addition, transparency of information is the one of the significant factors for the good governance, one of the decision-making principles for energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2015). Palm (2017), further, suggested disseminating information through seminars and internet web browsers to increase PV diffusion in consideration of importance of the spread of information.</p>
<p>Second, social influence is another barrier to adoption. This is because lack of community involvement or interactions would not help increasing PV adoption. For example, Wolske et al. (2018) found underlying consumer motivations and predispositions, such as perceived social support and consumer innovation, are more significant to decision making to PV adoption. Furthermore, Noll et al. (2014) pointed out the importance of perceived social support and peer effects by accommodating pro-solar opinion leaders, hosting workshops and connecting consumers with PV adopters in the community. Curtius et al. (2018) stressed the social influences on the decision to adopt PV by suggesting snowball effects which facilitate the creation of regional hot spots compared to the shotgun approach of uniform nationwide incentives.</p>
</div>
<div id="shared-solar" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> Shared solar</h2>
<p>NREL (2015) estimated that about 50% of consumers and businesses are unable to host PV systems due to not owning house, not enough finance, and not enough area to install rooftop PV. Other reasons are: roof is too shaded or requiring re-roofing; the size, orientation, or type of roof are not proper; some equipment is obstructing a PV installation; multi-unit dwellings (MUDs) or renters are hard to control their rooftop; and a homeowner is planning to move out in the near future. In this regard, Noll et al. (2014) suggested to focus on MUD households by encouraging solar cooperatives and community organizations to increase PV adoption. Furthermore, Graziano et al. (2019) suggested that share-ownership initiatives are necessary to include densely populated areas and lower-income areas to promote PV diffusion. As a result, shared solar models could work for those who can’t afford to install PV. By opening the market to these people including low- and moderate-income (LMI) residents, shared solar could represent 32%-49% of the distributed PV market in 2020 with a growing cumulative PV deployment in 2015-2020 by 5.5-11.0 GW and representing $8.2-$16.3 billions of cumulative investment (Feldman et al. 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify not only the barriers to residential PV adoption but also the barriers to shared solar, which could represent at least 30% and even around 50% of the distributed PV market.</p>
<p>Shared solar is designed to increase access to solar energy and to reduce upfront costs for participants. Thus, it allows a group of citizens to invest in solar that isn’t affixed to their own residence so shared solar avails this technology to a wider demographic (Augustine 2015). Shared solar is a purchasing arrangement in which multiple customers share the electricity or the economic benefits of solar power from a single array. An array is typically built in a single location, and individual customers sign up to own or lease parts of the array, or to purchase (or be credited for) some portion of the electricity generated by the array. Factors to identify from the customers’ perspectives are involved with (1) ownership structure of the PV array, (2) how to buy or join shared solar programs, (3) how it would be easy to subscribe or cancel, (4) the rate structure, and (5) financial benefits.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.8</span> Barriers to shared solar</h2>
<p>Barriers to shared solar from the developer’s perspective are (1) acquiring and retaining customers, (2) dealing with turnover and default risks of customers, and (3) how to bill and credits to customers. For example, involving LMI households may entails financial barriers to the shared solar developer. This is because having LMI communities lead to higher customer acquisition cost, increased project financing cost, subscription management cost, and electricity energy burden. Furthermore, shared solar developer would need to review eligibility verification for LMI community. Compared to residential PV, shared solar has high upfront cost, multi-year payback periods, and high interest for loan. Customer turnover-default risk regarding subscription management is another financial barrier. To reduce the financial barrier resulting from the default, it would be necessary to perform customer eligibility verification based on income and location of the applicants, and whether being in an existing program such as Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LMI housing agencies could be referred to as sureties for qualified LMI participants (NREL 2018).</p>
<p>Shared solar site selection would be the other barrier since location affects subscription and cost of the project. If the site is located within utility service area, while far from LMI community, lower subscription and higher cost would occur. This option is only possible where interaction with net metering is allowed. LMI neighborhood could be the site for shared solar projects leading to a local economy benefit while lack of land availability would be common. Having brown fields for the shared solar site may cause higher development cost and project permit may take longer. Other site options would be on utility grid, public land, and rooftop. Installation on rooftop may be attractive in urban, but needs to consider utility metering policies and higher cost for installation (NREL 2018).</p>
<p>Political and financial barriers vary between states and program models while they are interrelated. Securing available tax benefits is the other barrier. Furthermore, policy landscape depending on jurisdiction, will decide whether electricity generated will be credited to subscribers through NEM, or whether the utility will enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase power directly from the energy producer (Augustine and McGavisk 2016). In short, those barriers are (1) occupants not owning the building, (2) lack of access to information, (3) difficulties with application submission, (4) stringent inspection requirements, (5) variation of solar incentives, (6) interconnection and net metering standards from state to state, (7) lack of regulatory clarity, and (8) lack of mandated or recommended guidance on program structure (Augustine and McGavisk 2016).</p>
<p>Bill-credit structure of subscription is a technical barrier since it requires to improve data management of billing and credit software (NREL 2018). For example, a separate billing software is required for customers to make payments to developers and get credits from utility. For those who cannot separate the billing due to living in master-metered building, direct bill crediting is possible through virtual NEM, which also requires software improvement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.9</span> EV charger specific barriers</h2>
<p>Idaho National Laboratories (2015) argued that 85% of all charge events occur at home and 50% of EV owners charge exclusively at home. Therefore, it is important to ensure residential EV charger installed at home and available whenever needed. However, “range anxiety” makes EV adoption hard. Range anxiety is the fear that a vehicle has insufficient range to reach its destination with respect to refueling/recharging time and the availability of refueling infrastructure. Thus, the availability of EV charging infrastructure has a significant effect on EV adoption. For example, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL 2017) argued that the public perceives a low availability of vehicle chargers and listed this as a barrier to adoption. Therefore, charging opportunities should be ubiquitous, fast, and inexpensive compared to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in order to increase EV adoption.</p>
<p>Availability of parking space is another barrier to install EV chargers. This is because parking space should be available first for a vehicle to be parked during charging. However, MUDs do not mainly have assigned individual parking space, even worse, sometimes no parking lot. Furthermore, renters generally cannot decide to install equipment to the building without permission from the landlord. As a result, some governments legislated to address the issue. For example, in Colorado, a tenant may install EV chargers at its own expense for its own use while the landlord may require reimbursement for the cost of electricity provided by the landlord for the use by the chargers or the landlord may charge a fee for access. This statute guarantees that renters have the right to install an EV charger, and at the same time protects the economic interest of the landlords from potential loss (Findlaw 2019).</p>
<p>High electrical load would be another barrier with a higher penetration of EVs. This is because increasing EVs would put an additional burden on the power grid by causing congestions in the neighbor. Furthermore, higher demand of EV charging would incur an increment of peak load resulting in reliability issue on the grid and investment on the grid capacity. Therefore, encouraging off-peak EV charging makes charging at home more affordable but also could reduce the cost of utility generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. However, Frost et al. (2019) argued that higher EV adoption rate actually pushes down the electricity rate. Synapse Energy Economics performed a study for the two utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) about the EV customers’ impact on the utilities’ revenue and cost. Most of EV charge events for those customers were on time-of-use (TOU), which changes the rate depending on a certain time a customer uses electricity and happened at off-peak time. Furthermore, those, who were not on TOU, still consumed less during on-peak, thus there was not much cost incurred to increase the capacity to accommodate the additional EV charging demand. TOU rates over 200 utility companies across the country, serves as the incentive and makes EV charging more affordable (Bradley 2017).</p>
<p>Frequent charging technology update would be other barrier to adoption. As the development of EV charging technologies goes on, the old versions of chargers might be eliminated in the near future. Other barriers are higher price, and lack of education and awareness about EVs (Stumpf 2019). Furthermore, out-of-date policies, rules, or regulations can become other barriers to adoption. This is because the policies have kept changing thus, quite confusing to customers. Moreover, policies are different from state to state. In this regard, local governments have the great potential to influence the adoption and development of EV and EV chargers within their jurisdictions. Much consideration and attention should be given towards local ordinances and administration that can ease the burden of EV adoption or EV charger development (DOE 2012).</p>
