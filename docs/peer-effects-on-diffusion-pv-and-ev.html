<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Washington State CETA features social justice and assistance to low-income households. It aims at not only equitable distribution of benefits, reduction of burdens to vulnerable communities, but also public health improvement, environmental benefits, and energy resilience. Furthermore, CETA requires that all utilities in the state implement energy assistance funding and programs to low-income households by means of bill reductions and weatherization, energy efficiency, and ownership in distributed energy resources such as PV. To that end, it is important to investigate how clean energy policies, programs, or campaigns affect diffusion of clean energy technologies in different communities.</p>
<p>Distribution patterns of clean energy technologies such as PV may not be explained by economic profitability alone such as solar insolation, electricity bills and financial incentives (Karteris and Papadopoulos 2012). There are other drivers affecting the adoption of such technologies. For example, local regulations, home ownership and peer effects also explain the distribution patterns (Hofierka et al. 2014, Graziano and Gillingham 2015). Behavioral factors such as social contagion or peer effects were found to be drivers for the diffusion of PV in addition to financial drivers resulting from the advent of grid parity (Curtius et al. 2018). Significant spatial spillover effects were also found between neighboring counties while the differences of economic incentive mainly influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of PV adoption (Dharshing 2016). While previous studies largely employed surveys to investigate the significance of peer effects, there is still a dearth of studies aimed at investigating the impact of peer effects on diffusion using objective data. Since social influence on decision making for the adoption of a new technology is underestimated (Nolan et al. 2008), the current study is based on a premise that the diffusion of clean energy technologies is impacted by non-financial factors such as local advocacy, spatial peer effects (SPE) and spillovers. In this regard this study will investigate how peer effects and local knowledge mobilization affects diffusion. In particular, spillover effects (social contagion) and local advocacy on diffusion of technologies will be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="literature-review-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Literature Review</h2>
<p>Social influence affects the diffusion of clean energy technologies. Wolske et al. (2018) discussed strategies in behavioral economics and psychology that increase the financial appeal of PV. They found underlying consumer motivations and predispositions such as perceived social support and consumer innovation are more significant as the primary factors than behavioral economics and psychology. Once the market is matured, the factors that influence consumer’s decision making shift (Heiskanen and Matschoss 2017). Therefore, they assumed that if the PV market is matured, the gain/loss frame, perceived temporal distance and clarity of marketing claims may have stronger influences on consumer decisions. Furthermore, importance of perceived social support and peer effects were addressed by highlighting pro-PV opinion leaders, hosting workshops and connecting consumers with PV adopters in the community (Noll et al. 2014). Curtius et al. (2018) stressed the social influences on the decision to adopt PV by suggesting snowball effects which facilitate the creation of regional hot spots rather than the shotgun approach of uniform nationwide incentives.</p>
<p>To investigate how and why peer effects work on the decision to adopt, descriptive norms explain what people typically do as people confirm these norms especially under the condition of high uncertainty (Nolan et al. 2008). In addition, injunctive norms suggest what people approve as socially expected. They found the number of PV installation as a descriptive norm affected PV adoption through social pressure (mediator or the injunctive norm). A higher number of PV installations in a neighborhood resulted in stronger social pressure as well as greater intentions to install PV.</p>
<p>Peer effects can be discussed by the strength of interpersonal ties and geographical proximity (Curtius et al. 2018). Furthermore, it has temporal aspects as adoption increases with the existence of previous PV (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012). Peer effects and local organizations promoting PV were found to be the most important local factors to PV diffusion (Palm 2017). Ryan (2017) performed a survey PV adopters in higher diffusion municipalities compared with lower diffusion municipalities. Neighboring effects on diffusion of clean energy technologies refer to externalities in which the characteristics or actions of a reference group affect an individual’s behavior or outcomes (Ryan 2017). Peer effects on diffusion of clean energy technologies could be investigated by spillover effects between neighboring communities or in terms of individual’s surrounding local built environments. Muller and Rode (2013) discussed peer effects based on spatial and temporal distance between installations. Brudermann et al. (2013) found word of mouth and informative meetings were significant factors for diffusion.</p>
<p>As PV is normally installed on the rooftop, visibility of PV could affect a neighbor’s decision on PV adoption. In this regard, visibility of clean energy technologies could be considered to be passive peer effects while positive word of mouth is categorized as active peer effects. Scott et al. (2011) discussed peer effects in terms of imitation, herd behavior, and social interaction with the term “active” for solar advocacy and “passive” for visibility in a neighborhood. Regarding the local advocacy, Curtius et al. (2018) suggested co-investments with local authorities, public–private partnerships (PPP), or solarize campaigns. Both active and passive peer effects were also found to influence PV adoption in Texas (Rai and Robinson1 2013).</p>
<p>Spatial models offer insights into spatial dynamics of the diffusion of innovations (i.e., clean energy technologies) that promote policies aimed at enabling transition to a low carbon economy that is just, efficient, and effective (Balta-Ozkan et al. 2015). The authors added that ignoring spatial dependence leads to biased and inconsistent estimate and loss of efficiency. Graziano et al. (2019) addressed spatial peer-effects (SPEs) and spatial spillovers regarding the built environment and jurisdictional boundaries with cross-sectional (OLS), panel (temporal), and spatial models. Spatiotemporal, built environment, socioeconomic variables including SPE with spatial factors within 0.5 to 4 miles were analyzed in addition to addressing spatial spillovers using a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model, a special case of the general spatial Durbin model (SDM). They found SPE decays as time passes and distance increases depending on the built environment.</p>
<p>Local agencies have been playing an important role in regard to local advocacy or active peer effects. For example, Solarize Northwest is a community-driven, neighborhood group purchase campaign from Spark Northwest (Northwest Sustainable Energy for Economic Development), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization aimed at creating communities of locally-controlled clean energy by solarize campaigns in cooperation with community organizations, solar contractors, utilities, city governments, and solar lenders. Communities take part in the program by attending workshops, getting site assessments, and contracting for installation. The local communities with the installed PV by the local advocative campaign in Seattle are as below.</p>
<ul>
<li>January-April 2011 Queen Anne 30 Queen Anne homes for 130 kilowatts</li>
<li>July-October 2011 Magnolia 29 Magnolia homes for 114 kilowatts</li>
<li>January-April 2012 NE 52 Northeast Seattle homes for 246 kilowatts</li>
<li>January-April 2013 NW 141 Northwest Seattle homes for 640 kilowatts</li>
<li>July-October 2013 Central/ SE 185 homes for 885 kilowatts</li>
<li>July – October 2014 SW 111 homes for 684 kW</li>
</ul>
<p>With financial incentives, peer effects will achieve diffusion in the targeted communities as peer effects play an important role in the early adoption stage of S-shaped diffusion curve (Rogers 1962) while it is uncertain for the matured market.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Methodology</h2>
<pre><code>Interrupted time series (ITS) identifies active peer effects:
* Impact of interventions (solarize campaign) at a time to adoption changes
* Comparing different groups (treatment: PV; control: EV chargers)

Multilevel models identify passive peer effects: 
* Level 1 concerns PV visibility around neighbors at a time
* Level 2 concerns socio-economic and  built environment characteristics (e.g., income and housing structure)</code></pre>
<p>This study aims to investigate the impact of Solarize Northwest campaign on diffusion in Seattle by using time series analysis including interrupted time series (ITS). The study results are expected to verify the impact of the campaign (local advocacy or active peer effects) on communities with respect to diffusion of PV and EV in Seattle. In addition, passive peer effects on diffusion of clean energy technologies will be also investigated to understand how the visibility of PV and EV can influence diffusion of the technologies by using multilevel models. The questions this study tries to answer are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does a local advocacy campaign or active peer effects affect diffusion of PV and EV? and</li>
<li>Do passive peer effects (visibility of neighborhood PV) affect diffusion in the community?</li>
</ol>
<p>This study employs an interdisciplinary approach using time series models and multilevel models in a spatio-temporal data analyses. The following five tasks describe the workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Aggregate the census tract data to neighborhood to identify trends of diffusion</li>
<li>Task 2: Find diffusion trends of clean energy technologies (PV and EV) for each neighborhood over 2009 - 2019 (spatio-temporal data analysis)</li>
<li>Task 3: Analyze local advocacy campaign or active peer effects on diffusion using time series models</li>
<li>Task 4: Analyze passive peer effects through visibility of neighborhood PV on diffusion using multilevel models</li>
<li>Task: 5: Construct a spatio-temporal diffusion model to explain the peer effects on diffusion</li>
</ul>
<p>ITS evaluates the interventions which is introduced at a population level over a clearly defined time period and that target the reference population outcomes. This analysis is suitable for a continuous sequence of observations over time with respect to the intervention which differentiates pre-intervention and post-intervention period. The outcome should be available after the intervention and the time intervals should be equally spaced over the study duration. Different models will be used for single and multiple groups. Single group analysis will investigate the impact of the intervention on diffusion of PV in Seattle, while multiple group analysis will have the same goal while employing EV or diffusion trend of PV on another community as a control group to verify the impact of the intervention. The equation is as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_t = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T_t+\beta_{2}X_t+\beta_{3}T_tX_t+\epsilon_t,
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where, T = the time elapsed since the start of the study; X = a dummy variable indicating the pre‐ or the post‐intervention period ;Y= the outcome at time;<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> = estimates the error; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> = estimates the base level of the outcome at the beginning

<p>The equation for multiple group analysis is as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_t = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T_t+\beta_{2}X_t+\beta_{3}T_tX_t+\beta_{4}Z+\beta_{5}ZT_t+\beta_{6}ZX_t+\beta_{7}ZT_tX_t+\epsilon_t
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where, Z = dummy variable for group; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_4\)</span> = difference between the groups at the beginning time point; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_5\)</span> = difference between the groups in prior trend; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_6\)</span> = difference between the groups in change in level; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_7\)</span> = difference between the groups in change in trend.</p>
<p>Multilevel models or hierarchical linear models are statistical models with measures at more than one level. In this study, individual households who installed PV were aggregated into a neighborhood level that leads to two hierarchical levels. The level 1 model is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_{ij} = \beta_{0j}+\beta_{1j}X_{ij}+e_{ij},
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(Y_{ij}\)</span> = the outcome or the dependent variable for an individual observation at Level 1 (subscript i is for individual case and subscript j is for the neighborhood); <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span> = the level 1 predictor; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{0j}\)</span> = the intercept of the dependent variable in neighborhood j; <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1j}\)</span> the slope for the relationship in neighborhood j; and <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span> = the random errors of prediction for the level 1 equation. The variable of the number of PV around the individual household within a certain distance could be a predictor in the level 1 equation.</p>
<p>In the level 2 regression equation, the dependent variables are the intercepts and the slopes in the lever 1 model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;\beta_{0j} = \alpha_{00}+\alpha_{01}W_{j}+u_{0j},\\
&amp;\beta_{1j} = \alpha_{10}+u_{ij},
\end{aligned} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{00}\)</span> = the intercept. This is the grand mean of the dependent variable across all the neighborhood when all the predictors are equal to 0; <span class="math inline">\(W_j\)</span> = the level 2 predictor; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{01}\)</span> = the overall regression coefficient, or the slope, between the dependent variable and the Level 2 predictor; <span class="math inline">\(u_{0j}\)</span> = the random error component; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{10}\)</span> = the overall regression coefficient, or the slope, between the dependent variable and the level 1 predictor; and <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> = the error component for the slope. Neighborhood characteristics such as built environment could be predictors in the level 2 equation.</p>

<p>The identified local advocacy is found to significantly influence the diffusion trend. The most significant factors to the diffusion are identified and compared (i.e., peer effects). This will confirm the importance of community involvement and peer effects on diffusion of clean energy technologies. Policy makers can increase diffusion of the desired clean energy technologies while saving the acquisition cost.</p>
