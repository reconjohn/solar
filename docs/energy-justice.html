<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Energy Justice</h1>
<p>Q1. The energy justice literature has been framed into several categories including distributional, recognition, procedural, and restorative justice for example. Discuss the literature within these emerging themes and the major contributions that have advanced our understanding and knowledge in each area and how this work is impacting energy planning and policymaking. Describe how your dissertation work is framed within this literature and how you are advancing this body of knowledge.</p>
<div id="introduction-3" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Energy systems have been changing in the human history - especially modern transition to distributed energy systems increasingly rely on low-carbon and advanced energy resources. However, this transition will not be just if certain populations receive the burdens disproportionately and are excluded from the new opportunities this transition offers. It would be even worse if decision-making processes are not accessible to all the populations including vulnerable communities. Therefore, it is important to identify how energy contributes social equity and further to define energy justice.</p>
</div>
<div id="social-equity-in-energy-justice" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Social equity in energy justice</h2>
<p>Social equity is essential to energy justice because energy and societal transformation has the potential to amplify equity issues as the distribution of benefits seems to be localized in higher income areas (Poruschi et al. 2019). Social equity can be addressed with environmental justice for fair treatment and involvement of the populations in the development, implementation and enforcement of public laws, regulations, and policies. The fair treatment and involvement should be inclusive of all people regardless of race, gender, origin, and income level. In this regard, energy justice has been framed further from environmental and climate justice (Fuller and McCauley 2016). For example, Heffron and McCauley (2017) introduced a concept, “family resemblances” as if overlapping and crisscrossing to suggest similarities of energy justice to environmental justice in 1970s and climate justice in 1990s.</p>
</div>
<div id="energy-justice-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Energy justice</h2>
<p>Energy justice from an inter-disciplinary perspective has recently received significant attention from justice scholars (Jenkins et al. 2016). As a result, energy justice has been conceptualized as one specific academic field in energy with the concern of equal distribution of costs imposed on communities and benefits from the access of the modern energy in addition to procedures of inclusive decision making (Sovacool et al. 2015). Energy justice applies justice principles to energy policy, energy production and delivery systems, energy consumption, and energy security (Jenkins et al. 2016). Furthermore, energy justice involves issues about affordable energy, energy security, fuel poverty (i.e., energy vulnerability on distributional unfairness), and politics of energy infrastructure (Fuller and McCauley 2016).</p>
<p>Sovacool and Dworkin (2015) suggested eight principles of energy justice as a decision-making tool for energy policy: (1) availability for energy security of supply; (2) affordability such as stable electricity prices; (3) due process of stakeholder’s participation in policy making process; (4) good governance with information, accountability, and transparency; (5) sustainability i.e., meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations; (6) intergenerational equity for present and future generation; (7) intragenerational equity for different communities access to energy; and (8) responsibility for environment, climate change, future generation, and non-human species. Moreover, Sovacool et al. (2017) suggested two more principles: (9) resistance, which is standing up to injustice and (10) intersectionality, which is intertwined with socioeconomic, political and environmental aspects.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributional-recognition-and-procedural-energy-justice" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Distributional, recognition and procedural energy justice</h2>
<p>Energy justice has been framed in distributional, recognition and procedural aspects for energy production and consumption (Jenkins et al. 2016). First, distributional justice identifies concerns in resource distribution by focusing on where are the uneven distribution of benefits, ills, and responsibilities associated with the uneven distribution. Second, recognition justice focuses on who it affects such as vulnerable communities which are left out from the benefits of renewable energy. The lack of recognition justice entails losing the insights of marginalized social groups. This could be even worse due to the social gap between global and local perceptions in recognizing the impact of a local energy infrastructure. Lastly, procedural justice identifies strategies for remediation in terms of decision-making, local knowledge mobilization, information disclosure, and institutional representation (Jenkins et al. 2016).</p>
<p>Jenkins et al. (2016) further, discussed those categorized frames of energy justice in terms of evaluative and normative reach. In the evaluative reach, distributional justice asks “where are the injustices?”; recognition justice, “who is ignored?”; and procedural justice, “is there fair process?” in order to investigate the mechanisms of energy justice. On the other hand, normative reach suggests remediation of the energy injustice by asking “how should we solve them?” for distributional justice, “how should we recognize?” for recognition justice, and “which new processes?” for procedural justice (Jenkins et al. 2016). Those questions help address energy injustice in energy planning and policymaking since regulatory agencies have started to consider social equity, health, and environmental factors in policy decision-making (Lukanov et al. 2019).</p>
</div>
<div id="restorative-energy-justice" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Restorative energy justice</h2>
<p>Jenkins et al. (2016) suggested three areas for future research: investigating non-activist origins of energy justice, engaging with economics, and uniting systems of production and consumption based on addressing distributional (what), recognition (who), and procedural (how) aspects. In this regard, restorative justice was introduced as an application in practice for energy justice through the concept of energy justice, education and engagement with economic policymaking (Heffron and McCauley 2017). First, restorative justice ensures energy justice to be applied in practice from three tenets - distribution, procedural and recognition justice. Life-cycle of an energy system, then, is considered in the context of a cosmopolitan perspective. For example, for an energy project, three phases could be outlined: (1) environmental impact assessments (when a project is designed or built); (2) social-license-to-operate with the local communities over the life-span of the energy infrastructure; and (3) energy financial reserve obligation to ensure the financial capacity to end the enregy infrastructure. Lastly, the ten principles of a decision-making tool described above would be employed to apply energy justice in practice to address injustice challenges (Heffron and McCauley 2017).</p>
</div>
<div id="energy-justice-to-energy-planning-and-policymaking" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Energy justice to energy planning and policymaking</h2>
<p>“Systems” thinking was suggested to include externalities for transition to low-carbon sources spanning resource mining, transmission, and waste in terms of social, economic, and environmental impacts (Jenkins et al. 2016). Heffron and McCauley (2017), further, suggested energy justice needs not only inter-disciplinary, but also multi- and trans-disciplinary practices of integration. This is because energy justice embraces other disciplines such as social equity, economics, politics, and environment which are combined and presenting emergent behaviors. However, energy policies have mainly focused on delivering low-cost outcomes as a goal supported by other disciplines. For example, World Energy Council (WEC) suggested “energy trilemma”: energy security, environmental sustainability, and energy equity (i.e., affordability and accessibility) to aim at a low-cost energy. The energy trilemma shows the trend of economic-led policies aimed at low-cost and efficient outcomes. This trend has led to reliance on fossil fuels and as a result, a low-carbon energy infrastructure or a low-carbon economy becomes a secondary concern for energy policy. In this regard, Heffron and McCauley (2017) suggested more just energy trilemma: (1) economics, (2) politics in terms of energy security, and (3) environment for climate change mitigation in order for the energy law and policy to achieve energy justice. “Green” investment funds are examples of the energy trilemma focusing on the energy justice rather than the low-cost outcomes through energy planning and policy (Heffron and McCauley 2017).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> The research framed in energy justice</h2>
<p>Recent global climate change has led to the development of various clean energy policies and technologies. Clean energy technologies are proven to increase resilience in response to the impacts of climate change in addition to their economic, health and environmental benefits. However, concerns regarding distributional and recognition energy justice have emerged with the current rapid transition of energy systems toward clean energy technologies.</p>
<p>First, the transition can inadvertently result in the uneven distribution of the clean energy technologies, and accordingly has the potential to disproportionately influence how communities respond to any undesirable climate change-related events. This is because distributed energy systems are the results of the transition and have the potential to reduce energy poverty by promoting social equity (Sovacool et al. 2014). Furthermore, the transition to renewable energy sources allows just distribution of risks in terms of an electricity generation by involving larger populations compared to a centralized solution (Jenkins et al. 2016). However, uneven distribution of new energy systems could be described as the “energy divide” (i.e., inequalities in access to energy services) which is similar to the “digital divide” in the late 20th century where uneven distribution of telecommunication infrastructure caused issues in social equity, which aims to provide equal opportunities to people regardless of who they are (i.e., recognition justice) and where they live (i.e., distributional justice). In this regard, uneven distribution of energy production facilities has been mainly approached by environmental justice while an affordable energy access has been discussed in terms of income equality from the perspective of energy consumption (Fuller and McCauley 2016).</p>
<p>Second, having more distributed clean energy technologies requires improvement of the grid system and it leads to higher electricity bills as a form of regressive taxation to customers including low-income households, who may not have access to these technologies. For example, reliability of the power supply for the community can be inadvertently affected by the intermittent power generation of photovoltaic systems (PV) and uncertain charging schedules of electric vehicles (EV). This challenges system operators (ISO) requiring improved forecasting, new operating tools ensuring stability, and coordination between systems. This is specially true for communities with higher decentralization trends due to the lack of active generation and demand connectivity as the communities require more diverse and less correlated power sources, energy storage and demand participation. In addition, those customers, who do not install clean energy technologies, might be unfairly charged for the costs to maintain transmission and distribution (T &amp; D) infrastructure (Brown 2016).</p>
<p>Furthermore, rebates, tax credits, production performance credits, property tax exemptions, and sales tax exemptions have led to energy inequalities as the forms of regressive taxation benefiting wealthier households by taxation on populations including low-income households (Poruschi et al. 2019). For example, Fit-in Tariffs (FiTs) lead to distributional injustice for low-income communities by transmitting the costs associated with infrastructure of decentralized electricity supplies to electricity consumers (Jenkins at al. 2016). Opportunities to take part in the incentives are hard for those who cannot afford to invest in the clean energy technologies. As a result, the cost burdens of the grid modernization and the regressive taxation are distributed to customers including those who may not have access to the technologies.</p>
<p>In addition, Bouzarovski and Simcock (2017) claimed the lack of geography in consideration of the injustice of energy poverty in terms of spatial justice, which is the geographical dimension of inequality and inequity. Spatial justice was discussed in regard to (1) landscapes of material deprivation for infrastructure and built environment; (2) geographic underpinnings of energy affordability (i.e., energy prices and household incomes); (3) vicious cycles of vulnerability as poor health occurs due to material and socioeconomic spatial inequalities; and (4) spaces of misrecognition, which is defined by recognition injustice (i.e., not identifying or ignoring certain groups where household practices are affected). They argued energy transitions are generators of geographically uneven social, political and environmental displacements which are leading to vulnerability of particular groups (Bouzarovski and Simcock 2017).</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, this research aims to study spatial diffusion dynamics of clean energy technologies (PV and EV) in the residential built environment in consideration of distributional and recognition justice. This research will identify socially and technically vulnerable neighborhoods (i.e., who, recognition justice) with regard to the uneven and unbalanced distribution of clean energy technologies (i.e., where, distributional justice) aimed at resilience against climate change and reliability of energy systems.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Advancing the body of knowledge</h2>
<p>This research has the potential for significant implications to both energy policy analysis and electricity network planning as it involves energy justice, public policy and urban planning. The present research will reveal social equity issues (i.e., certain communities are underserved) based on the uneven distribution of benefits and costs of clean energy technologies by identifying vulnerable neighborhoods. This will help policy makers to better support any underserved communities with limited resources (e.g., renters and low-income households that have less disposable income for PV and EV) by devising equitable policies in response to climate change. Furthermore, the study results will support policy makers and system operators to make informed investment decision on allocating energy distribution systems and scalable renewable energy infrastructures for vulnerable communities in consideration of energy justice. This is because the fair distribution (i.e., distributional justice or redistribution) and impartiality in decision-making (i.e., procedural justice and empowerment) are interconnected in that energy justice should be the first to consider for populations the energy policies are intended to benefit (Sovacool and Dworkin 2015).</p>
