# Diffusion Dynamics of Clean Energy Technologies in the Residential Built Environments

## Abstract 

The recent global climate change has led to the development of various clean energy policies and technologies. Clean energy technologies are proven to increase resilience in response to the impacts of climate change in addition to their economic, health and environmental benefits. However, two main concerns have emerged with the current rapid transition of energy systems toward clean energy technologies. 

First, the transition can inadvertently result in the uneven distribution of clean energy technologies, and accordingly has potential to disproportionately influence how communities respond to any undesirable climate change-related events. Such uneven distribution of new energy systems could be described as the “energy divide” (inequalities in access to energy services) which is similar to the “digital divide” in the late 20th century where uneven distribution of telecommunication infrastructure caused issues in social equity, which aims atto provide equal opportunities to people regardless of who they are and where they live. To make matters worse, having more distributed clean energy technologies requires improvement of the grid system leading to higher electricity bills as a form of regressive taxation to low-income households, who may not have access to these technologies. 

Second, reliability of the power supply for the community can inadvertently be affected by intermittent power generation of photovoltaic systems (PV) and uncertain charging schedules of electric vehicles (EV). This increases challenges to system operators requiring improved forecasting, new operating tools ensuring stability and coordination between systems. This is especially true for regions with higher decentralization trends due to the lack of active generation and demand connected as the regions require more diverse and less correlated power sources, energy storage and demand participation. In response to these two concerns, this study aims to study diffusion dynamics of clean energy technologies (PV and EV) in the residential built environment. The objectives of the proposed study include:

1.	To investigate the current status of distribution of clean energy technologies (PV and EV) and their relationships with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics of local communities (i.e., based on census tracts); 
2.	To validate the diffusion patterns of PV and EV;
3.	To identify local advocacy, peer effects and spillovers on diffusion trends; and 
4.	To develop a robust spatiotemporal prediction model based on the identified factors. 

The study identifies socially and technically vulnerable communities with regards to the uneven and unbalanced distribution of clean energy technologies (PV and EV) in consideration of resilience against climate change and reliability of energy systems. Therefore, the study will help policy makers to better support underserved communities with limited resources by devising equitable clean energy policies. As a result, it will promote desirable distribution in consideration of appropriate boundaries of reliable electrical systems in regard to clean energy technologies.
